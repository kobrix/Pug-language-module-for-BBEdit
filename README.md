# Pug language module for BBEdit

BBEdit codeless language module for the [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) template engine.

Requires [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) v10.1 or greater by [Barebones](https://barebones.com/).

The file is a `.plist` property list.

## Installation

- Copy `pug.plist` to the **Language Modules** folder in BBEdit’s **Application Support** folder:

		~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/

- Relaunch BBEdit

An easy way to open the correct folder is to choose **Language Modules** from the **Folders** menu, under the BBEdit application menu.

## Features

- Keys are listed following the order in Barebones’s [Codeless Language Modules](http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html) documentation
- HTML elements are grouped by function following [Mozilla’s reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
- [Deprecated elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Obsolete_and_deprecated_elements) are listed last under their own section but commented out (check here first if you find that an HTML element isn’t being coloured correctly)
- The file is heavily commented, largely for the benefit of future me, but also hoping that it might help others.
- Note for Usanians: ‘colour’ = ‘color’ (I’m a Brit)
